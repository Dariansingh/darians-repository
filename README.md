# darians-repository
My first repository.
If I ever need help with programming, I can use michael as a reference or youtube.
I can also go onto udemy and get a tutorial.

What are branches -> 
branches are different stages of development of your code. 
To best use branches and ensure that your program wont break and that you always have a working application
you must have three branches for "Proffessional Development". This is also useful for when mistakes occur because
you can revert changes easily.

-Master- The branch that is always live and working for the public
-Test- The branch where you are ensuring that everything works, before it goes to the public
-Development- The branch where you are developing and creating the application



**example for file path and naming** 
front-end-folder/components/viewer-counter.js
